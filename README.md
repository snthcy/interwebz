# synthicy's personal website

My personal website which started off from [html and css](https://github.com/synthicy/website) and now with Next.js,
Javascript, and TailwindCSS is a personal parking spot for all of my projects to showcase, statistics, and ways to reach
me.

## Credits

Huge thanks to [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/) for providing amazing and free of cost courses to teach people
like me React and Next.js. The general design of the website is inspired from him and
the  [next.config.js](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/main/next.config.js) file is based from his repo.
